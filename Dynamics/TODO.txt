 * add more types/methods to mutability whitelist
 * current approach to circlar copy resolution doesn't work well
   enough, particularly for immutable types whose children
   have back refs/aren't themselves immutable, ie. delegates,
   ReadOnlyCollection<object>, etc. Maybe have to switch to
   a late-binding resolver, where a list of delegates to
   run is queued and executed on completion

 1. Support any number of parameters.
 2. Search for candidate methods among all parameter types.
 3. Full parameter unification, so parameters can be by-ref
    types, regular types, generic types, etc. [1]
