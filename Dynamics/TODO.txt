 * add more types/methods to mutability whitelist
 * current approach to circlar copy resolution doesn't work well
   enough, particularly for immutable types whose children
   have back refs/aren't themselves immutable, ie. delegates,
   ReadOnlyCollection<object>, etc. Maybe have to switch to
   a late-binding resolver, where a list of delegates to
   run is queued and executed on completion
 * structural equality: better handle internal fields that aren't 
   observable, eg. List<T>._version. I think for types that implement
   IEnumerable, we should just compare enumerated values via:
     x.Zip(y).All(z => StructuralEquals(z.Item1, z.Item2))
 * structural equality: better handle overriding equality for
   generic types, eg. specify an override constructor for List<> rather
   than one for List<T0>, one for List<T1>, List<T2>, etc. Maybe
   override should accept a LINQ expression, and then extract
   expression and recompile for each new type.

 1. Support any number of parameters.
 2. Search for candidate methods among all parameter types.
 3. Full parameter unification, so parameters can be by-ref
    types, regular types, generic types, etc. [1]
